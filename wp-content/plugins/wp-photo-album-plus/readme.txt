== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* The plugin requires at least wp version 3.0.
* The theme should have a call to wp_head() in its header.php file and wp_footer() in its footer.php file. 
* The theme should load enqueued scripts in the header if the scripts are enqueued without the $in_footer switch (like wppa.js and jQuery). 
* The theme should not prevent this plugin from loading the jQuery library in its default wp manner, i.e. the library jQuery in safe mode (uses jQuery() and not $()). 
Most themes comply with these requirements. 
However, check these requirements in case of problems with new installations with themes you never had used before with wppa+ or when you modifies your theme.

= Upgrade notice =
This version is: Major rev# 4, Minor rev# 6, Fix rev# 0, Hotfix rev# 000.
If you are upgrading from a previous Major or Minor version, note that:
* If you modified wppa_theme.php and/or wppa_style.css, you will have to use the newly supplied versions. The previous versions are NOT compatible.
* If you set the userlevel to anything else than 'administrator' you may have to set it again. Note that changing the userlevel can be done by the administrator only!
* You may have to activate the sidebar widget again.

= Standard installation when not from the wp plugins page =
* Unzip and upload the wppa plugin folder to wp-content/plugins/
* Make sure that the folder wp-content/uploads/ exists and is writable by the server (CHMOD 755)
* Activate the plugin in WP Admin -> Plugins.
* If, after installation, you are unable to upload photos, check the existance and rights (CHMOD 755) of: 
for the single site mode installation: the folders .../wp-content/uploads/wppa/ and .../wp-content/uploads/wppa/thumbs/, 
and for the multisite mode installation (example for blog id 92): the folders path: .../wp-content/blogs.dir/92/wppa/ and .../wp-content/blogs.dir/92/wppa/thumbs/.
In rare cases you will need to create them manually. You can see the actual pathnames and urls in the lowest table of the Photo Albums -> Settings page.
* If you upgraded from WP Photo Album (without plus) and you had copied wppa_theme.php and/or wppa_style.css 
to your theme directory, you must remove them or replace them with the newly supplied versions. The fullsize will be reset to 640 px. 
See Table I-A1 and Table I-B1,2 of the Photo Albums -> Settings admin page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which other plugins do you recommand to use with WPPA+, and which not? =

* Recommanded plugins: qTranslate, Lightbox 3, WP Super Cache, AddThis.
* Plugins that break up WPPA+: My Live Signature.

= After update, many things seem to go wrong =

* After an update, always clear your browser cache (CTRL+F5) and clear your temp internetfiles, this will ensure the new versions of js files will be loaded.
* And - most important - if you use a server side caching program clear its cache. (No longer needed as of version 4.4.2)
* Visit the Photo Albums -> Settings page -> Table VII-A1 and press Do it!
* When upload fails after an upgrade, one or more columns may be added to one of the db tables. In rare cases this may have been failed. 
Unfortunately this is hard to determine. 
If this happens, make sure (ask your hosting provider) that you have all the rights to modify db tables and run action Table VII-A1 again.

= What do i have to do when converting to multisite? =

* After the standard WP conversion procedure the photos and thumbnails must be moved to a different location on the server.
You have to copy all files and subdirectories from .../wp-content/uploads/wppa/ to .../wp-content/blogs.dir/1/wppa/
This places all existing photos to the 'upload' directory that belongs to blog id 1.
Make sure the files are accessable by visitors (check CHMOD and .htaccess).
Further, activate the plugin for all other blogs that require it.

= How does the search widget work? =

* A space between words means AND, a comma between words means OR.
Example: search for 'one two, three four, five' gives a result when either 'one' AND 'two' appears in the same (combination of) name and description. 
If it matches the name and description of an album, you get the album, and photo vice versa.
OR this might apply for ('three' AND 'four') OR 'five'. Albums and photos are returned on one page, regardless of pagination settings, if any. 
That's the way it is designed.

= How can i translate the plugin into my language? =

* See the documentation on the WPPA+ Docs & Demos site: http://wppa.opajaap.nl/?page_id=1349

= How do i install a hotfix? =

* See the documentation on the WPPA+ Docs & Demos site: http://wppa.opajaap.nl/?page_id=823

= What to do if i get errors during upload or import photos? =

* It is always the best to downsize your photos to the Full Size before uploading. It is the fastest and safest way to add photos tou your photo albums.
Photos that are way too large take unnessesary long time to download, so your visitors will expierience a slow website. 
Therefor the photos should not be larger (in terms of pixelsizes) than the largest size you are going to display them on the screen.
WP-photo-album-plus is capable to downsize the photos for you, but very often this fails because of configuration problems. 
Here is explained why:
Modern cameras produce photos of 7 megapixels or even more. To downsize the photos to either an automaticly downsized photo or
even a thumbnail image, the server has to create internally a fullsize fullcolor image of the photo you are uploading/importing.
This will require one byte of memory for each color (Red, Green, Blue) and for every pixel. 
So, apart form the memory required for the server's program and the resized image, you will need 21 MB (or even more) of memory just for the intermediate image.
As most hosting providers do not allow you more than 32 MB, you will get 'Out of memory' errormessages when you try to upload large pictures.
You can configure WP to use 64 MB (That would be enough in most cases) by specifying *define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '64M');* in wp-config.php, 
but, as explained earlier, this does not help when your hosting provider does not allows the use of that much memory.
If you have control over the server yourself: configure it to allow the use of enough memory.
Oh, just Google on 'picture resizer' and you will find a bunch of free programs that will easily perform the resizing task for you.

Note: If you had set the 2 column treshold exactly to the column width before, 
you may need to change this setting as the old value (that will be used) will result in one column instead of two.

= Other changes =

* Reverted the change made in version 3.1.3 for the algorithm to decide if the indicator must be printed.

You can correct this by adding the following line of code just prior to *the_excerpt();* in the template files involved: *global $wppa; $wppa['is_excerpt'] = true;*
* Uses display name rather than login name in comments on photos.

= 3.1.2 =

= 3.0.7 =

= Enhancements =

* The way the plugin is re-activated after an update has been changed due to the fact that wp does no longer run the activation hook after update.
You should no longer get the messages that the 'database rev is not yet updated' and 'i fixed that for you'. 
Manual re-initialization still remains possible with the settings page table VIII item 3.
* The horizontal alignment of the photo of the day widget content can be set to none, left, center or right on the photo of the day admin page.
The text goes along; if you want the photo and the text align differently, set alignment to --- none --- and use css (classes wppa-widget-photo and wppa-widget-text).
* Added script keyword: #last. %%photo=#last%% or %%mphoto=#last%% gives the last added photo. %%album, %%cover, %%slide=#last%% etc gives the last added album.

It works for both admin as well as site views. Links within the WPPA+ system include the debug switch (and optional value).
The main wp admin menu items are beyond the scope of this feature. Press the menuitem, append &debug to the adressbar here.
* You can optionally switch the filmstrip and/or the browsebar on in the slideshow widget.
* Clicking the counter (Photo xx of yy, or xx / yy in the mini version) will start/stop the slideshow.
* You can specify an album for the topten widget. Now it is usefull to have more than one topten widget by using different albums.

* If you had set *No Links* for thumbnails, you will have to set it again.

== Known issues ==

* The Big Browse Buttons are transparent. IE 6 does not know about transparency. Therefor the slidshow will not display properly in IE6 with BBB's enabled.
* The plugin My Live Signature completely destroys the display from wppa+ and also damages other filters. DO NOT INSTALL My Live Signature!
* The theme Moses from Churchthemer.com uses jQuery in unsafe mode. This conflicts with prototype. Therefor you can NOT use WPPA+ embedded lightbox.
* The plugin Shortcodes Ultimate formats the content and thereby damages the wppa+ generated code by a filter at priority 99. 
Set the wppa+ filter priority to at least 100 to deal with this conflicting situation. (Table IX item 10)
